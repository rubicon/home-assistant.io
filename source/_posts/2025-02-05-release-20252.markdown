Home Assistant 2025.2! ‚ù§Ô∏è

In the previous release, we [overhauled our backup system](/blog/2025/01/03/release-20251/#overhaul-of-the-backup-system),
and the response was overwhelming! Tons of suggestions and feature requests
came in, so this release is‚Äîonce again‚Äîfocused on backups. Based on this
community feedback, we‚Äôve added loads of improvements, including the first
integrations to store your backups in **Google Drive**
and **Microsoft OneDrive**!

This release also brings exciting new features to **Voice**! Home Assistant can
now call your **analog phone**, and when dinner is ready, you can **broadcast**
that message to all voice assistants in your home! But wait‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs more!

On **February 12, 2025**, we‚Äôre streaming live on YouTube all about Voice:
[**Voice - Chapter 9**](https://www.youtube.com/live/k6VvzDSI8RU)! üéô
Be sure to subscribe and hit the bell so you don‚Äôt miss it. üõé

Before diving into the release notes, I also want to give a shoutout to our
friends at [**ESPHome**](https://esphome.io/) powering so much of the Home
Assistant ecosystem, including Home Assistant Voice PE! And
on **February 19th**, they‚Äôll be hosting a
[**live release party for ESPHome 2025.2**](https://www.youtube.com/live/HtG3fjAO96c)! üéâ

Enjoy the release!

## Iterating on backups

In the previous release, we [fully revamped the entire backup experience](/blog/2025/01/03/release-20251/#overhaul-of-the-backup-system)
and added many new features to make it easier to use. That release set the
stage for the next iterations and opened up the ability for integrations to
provide locations to store backups.

We've received **a lot** of feedback on the new backup system, which is awesome! ‚ù§Ô∏è
All the feedback helped us prioritize the most requested features, and other
improvements to the backup system.

This release includes a lot of the most requested improvements and abilities.

### Unencrypted backups

The new backup system came with a lot of security improvements, including
encryption of backups. However, as it turns out, many users use these backups
to extract and restore single files or configurations, a use case in which
encryption made things more difficult. In this release we made two changes
to the backup system to address this.

#### Ability to turn off encryption for specific locations

While our default recommendation remains to encrypt backups, as of this
release, you can turn off encryption on a per location basis. This allows you
to store backups on you local NAS, for example, in an unencrypted format.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the option to turn off encryption for a specific backup location." src="/images/blog/2025-02/backups-turn-off-encryption.png" />

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the backup locations, one location indicates that encryption has been turned off." src="/images/blog/2025-02/backups-encryption-turned-off.png" />

There is one exception to this, which is [Home Assistant Cloud](/cloud). Backups
stored in Home Assistant Cloud will always be encrypted, and encryption cannot
be turned off. At Nabu Casa, we take your privacy and security very seriously,
and we never ever want to be able to access your data.

#### Downloading backups unencrypted

When downloading backups from the Home Assistant interface, you will now always
download the backup in an unencrypted format that can be extracted using your
favorite archive tool.

This works for all backups, regardless of the encryption settings of the
location in which they are stored. For instance, if you download an encrypted
backup from Home Assistant Cloud through the Home Assistant interface,
it will decrypt the backup on the fly while you download it.

### Customize the time of your backups

The initial iteration of the backup system scheduled backups to run at 4:45 AM,
but this time wasn't ideal for everyone. Some, for example, turned off their
network storage during the night, meaning the backup would fail.

This release, we added the ability to customize the time of your backups to your
liking. Additionally, if you choose to make weekly backups, you can now select
the days of the week you want the backup to run.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the backup configuration options, you can now set your own time and select which days to backup." src="/images/blog/2025-02/backups-customize-backups-change.png" />

### Taking backups on an advanced schedule

The above backup time changes not flexible enough for you? Well, you are in luck! In this
release, we added an action (`backup.create_automatic`) that you can use
to trigger a backup, with your preferred settings, in an automation.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing an automation in the automation editor that is using the new action to create an automated backup." src="/images/blog/2025-02/backups-action.png" />

This allows you to create automated backups on any schedule you like, or even
add conditions and actions around it. For example, you could make an automation
that triggers on a calendar, wakes up your network storage, waits till it is
online, and then starts a backup.

### Re-introduction of the backup toggle on update

If you run Home Assistant OS, you get updates for Home Assistant along with
all your add-ons. The update dialog used to have a toggle to create a backup
before updating, which was removed in the previous release.

This change was made because this feature was considered redundant when running
regular automated backups. However, we‚Äôve received a lot of feedback that many
people relied on these backups to ensure they had the latest data, for instance,
if they needed to roll back to a previous version of an add-on. We are
re-introducing this backup on update toggle in this release, but in a smarter
way. ü§ì

#### Backup on updating Home Assistant

When updating Home Assistant, the toggle is now turned off by default and
shows the last time you made a backup. This allows you to decide whether to make
a new backup before updating.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing an Home Assistant Core update dialog, giving the option to make a backup before update." src="/images/blog/2025-02/backups-before-update-core.png" />

If you turn the switch on, a full automated backup is created and synced to
your configured locations, before the update is started.

This full sync is done to ensure you have the most recent backup available in
case the update causes issues and you need to restore your system. In the rare
case a Home Assistant update fatally fails and you can‚Äôt access the backup page,
if you‚Äôve configured a second backup location, you‚Äôll be able to download it
from there.

#### Backup on updating add-ons

Things are slightly different when updating add-ons. The toggle exists here too,
and is disabled by default. However, when you enable it, only a backup of your
add-on and its data is created. That way you can keep around the previous
version of the add-on, so you can always roll back to it if needed.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing an Home Assistant add-on update dialog, giving the option to make a backup before update." src="/images/blog/2025-02/backups-addons-before-update.png" />

To prevent your system from filling up with old add-on backups, we only retain
one backup per add-on, automatically deleting the previous backup whenever
a new one is created. Add-on backups you created manually, of course,
remain untouched and will not be deleted automatically.

### Improved filenames for backups

One piece of feedback we‚Äôve seen a lot, is that the filenames created by backups
can be a bit cryptic and hard to understand for humans.

This feedback was fair, as the filename was a hash and originally not designed
to be human-readable. This method was not newly introduced in the last release,
but it was made more apparent with the new backup system and locations.

So, in this release, we've improved the filenames of the backups stored on your
backup locations. The filename now includes the date and time the backup was
created, making it easier to understand and identify the backup you are looking
for, even outside of Home Assistant.

### New locations

This release also introduces new locations to store your backups. There are new
integrations for [Google Drive](/integrations/google_drive/) and
[Microsoft OneDrive](/integrations/onedrive/), and backup support was added to
the [Synology DSM](/integrations/synology_dsm) integration.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the backup configuration panel, with all possible backup integrations set up!" src="/images/blog/2025-02/backups-new-locations.png" />

## Voice

Assist, our [private voice assistant](/voice_control/), is getting a few new
features in this release. If you don't have Assist set up yet, check out our
[Home Assistant Voice: Preview Edition](/voice-pe/) to get started.

### Home Assistant will be able to call your analog phone to tell you a message

Remember our tutorial on turning an analog phone into the
[world's most private voice assistant](/voice_control/worlds-most-private-voice-assistant/)?
Thanks to [Jamin](https://github.com/jaminh), we now have a way to call
your analog phone from Home Assistant!

You can use [`assist_satellite.announce`](/integrations/assist_satellite#action-assist_satelliteannounce)
to have Home Assistant call your phone and play a message when someone picks up
the phone.

If you use an LLM as the brains for your voice assistant, you can take this one
step further with the new [`assist_satellite.start_conversation`](/integrations/assist_satellite#action-assist_satellitestart_conversation)
action. Instead of playing an announcement, it starts a conversation between
Home Assistant and the user, with Home Assistant saying the first message.
Left the garage door open for 30 minutes? No problem, let Home Assistant call
and ask if they want to close it.

_(Starting a conversation with the default conversation agent is a bit more work
and did not make it this release)._

### New Broadcast intent

You can now broadcast messages to every other voice assistant in your home.
Try it by saying _"Broadcast it is time for dinner"_.
As always with new intents, support may vary
[depending on your language](https://home-assistant.github.io/intents/),
but our language leaders are working hard on making sure it will be supported
soon in your language!

### Setting Temperature on Thermostat

A few releases ago we introduced an intent to get the current temperature from
a climate device. As of this release, you can also set the target temperature
of your thermostat by voice.

By saying _"Set the temperature to 19 degrees"_ this will smartly target the
area you are in (if you have a thermostat per area, such as thermostatic valves
on your radiators) or the floor you are in (if you only have a central unit).
You can also target specific devices by name if you prefer.

### LLMs meet calendars

Without complex custom tooling, LLM-based conversation agents previously could
not fetch events from your calendar. This release changes that. Out of the box,
LLM-based agents can now retrieve today‚Äôs and this week‚Äôs events from any of
your calendars. Don‚Äôt forget to
[expose your calendar entities](/voice_control/voice_remote_expose_devices/)
to enable this functionality.

### Shared history between the default conversation agent and its LLM-based fallback

In [2024.12](/blog/2024/12/04/release-202412/) we introduced a lovely feature
that allowed you to use our fast and local default conversation agent for most
queries while still being able to fall back to a much more powerful LLM-based
agent for more complex queries.

This introduced some interesting behaviors. From a user perspective, it looked
like you were talking to the same assistant, whereas, in reality, nothing was
shared between the two agents. This led to some less-than-optimal scenarios,
such as this one:

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of missing history in the conversation" src="/images/blog/2025-02/conversation-history-before.png" />

The first command is processed locally by our default agent, but the follow-up
request is processed by the LLM-based agent. Since no memory is shared, it does
not understand what device you want to turn off.

Starting with this release, both agents now share the same command history,
helping address this issue.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the new improved behavior" src="/images/blog/2025-02/conversation-history-after.png" />

### Model Context Protocol

This release adds the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)
to Home Assistant thanks to [Allen][@allenporter]. Home Assistant can both be an
[MCP server](/integrations/mcp_server/) and an
[MCP client](/integrations/mcp/). From the MCP website:

> MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

To give it a try yourself, [check out this client demo](https://gist.github.com/allenporter/b0e9946feb2ab60901c4f467ac1ba6f9).

### Now available to set up from the UI

While most {% term integrations %} can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.

The following integration is now available via the Home Assistant UI:

- **[NMBS]**, done by [@silamon]
- **[Filter]**, done by [@gjohansson-ST]

## Other noteworthy changes

- When using the [Generic thermostat], setting a temperature that matches
  one of the presets will automatically select that preset as active.
  Thanks [@domingues]!
- [Time triggers] in automations can now be offset when using datetime input
  helpers. Thanks [@Petro31]!

## Bluetooth config panel

The [Bluetooth integration] now has its own configuration panel! üíô

The panel is accessible by going to **Settings** > **Device & services**. Find
and select the **Bluetooth** integration, and next select **Configure**.

This new panel gives you access to the Bluetooth integration options and
insights into the connection slot allocations. More importantly,
it has an advertisement monitor!

Selecting **Advertisement monitor** will open a new panel, where you can see
information about your Bluetooth devices, including the raw advertisement data
and how they are connected to your Home Assistant instance. This includes
which [Bluetooth proxy] it connects through!

## Preparing our graphs for the future

This release includes a major overhaul of every graph we display and show in
Home Assistant. We have entirely replaced the software library that renders
these graphs in the frontend.

You can most definitely tell things have changed, but everything still looks
very similar. The latter was our goal for now, as we wanted the existing
experience to be familiar.

However, this change is a preparation for the future. We have many plans and
ideas for our graphs, and this change was a necessary step to make those plans
possible.

## Patch releases

We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2025.2 in February.
These patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch
release every Friday.

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "Ecovacs" %}

The attributes on the vacuum entity for the lifespan of the main brush, side
brush, and filter have been deprecated and are now removed. These attributes
are superseded by dedicated sensor entities.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#134492]) ([documentation](/integrations/ecovacs))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#134492]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/134492

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Home Connect" %}

Some appliances might lose their power entity as the API does not report the
power setting.

([@Diegorro98] - [#135930]) ([documentation](/integrations/home_connect))

[@Diegorro98]: https://github.com/Diegorro98
[#135930]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/135930

{% enddetails %}

{% details "IMGW-PIB" %}

Some hydrology data is no longer available to Home Assistant users via IMGW-PIB
API and for this reason, the following entities are removed:

- `flood alarm` binary sensor
- `flood alarm level` sensor
- `flood warning` binary sensor
- `flood warning level` sensor

([@bieniu] - [#134668]) ([documentation](/integrations/imgw_pib))

[@bieniu]: https://github.com/bieniu
[#134668]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/134668

{% enddetails %}

{% details "KNX" %}

The "State Updater" option in the integration settings now works as intended.
Previously, the option wasn‚Äôt applied correctly.

- When disabled: KNX will only read a `state_address` once when the connection
  is established.
- When enabled: KNX will also read any `state_address` if no value has been
  received for one hour.

Please review your integration settings to ensure this option is configured
according to your preferences.

([@farmio] - [#135611]) ([documentation](/integrations/knx))

[@farmio]: https://github.com/farmio
[#135611]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/135611

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Litter-Robot" %}

Remove extra_state_attributes from Litter-Robot vacuum entities.
These were previously migrated to sensors.

([@natekspencer] - [#136196]) ([documentation](/integrations/litterrobot))

[@natekspencer]: https://github.com/natekspencer
[#136196]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/136196

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT" %}

To change the MQTT broker settings, you need to start a reconfiguration.
When `CONFIGURE` is selected, MQTT shows a "MQTT settings" page with subscribe
and publish tools. The `Re-configure MQTT` button will be replaced with
an `MQTT options` page.

The reconfiguration option will only be available from the MQTT integration
entry context menu.

([@jbouwh] - [#133342]) ([documentation](/integrations/mqtt))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#133342]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/133342

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Pentair ScreenLogic" %}

Raw states derived from ScreenLogic enums are now lowercase instead of Title
Case. This change impacts:

- pH/ORP dosing state sensor entities:
  - `Dosing` -> `dosing`
  - `Mixing` -> `mixing`
  - `Monitoring` -> `monitoring`
- The `preset_mode` state attribute for ScreenLogic climate entities, where
  raw states have also been underscored-spaced and had any punctuation removed.
  - `Solar` -> `solar`
  - `Solar Preferred` -> `solar_preferred`
  - `Heater` -> `heater`
  - `Don't Change` -> `dont_change`

These changes support the addition of translation keys for text-based entity
states. You should update any references to the above states/preset_modes to
the new, lowercase versions.
