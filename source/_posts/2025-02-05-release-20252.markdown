## Iterating on backups

In the previous release, we fully revamped the whole backup experience and added
a lot of new features to make it easier to use. That release set the stage for
next iterations and opened up the ability for integrations to provide locations
to store backups.

We've received **a lot** of feedback on the new backup system, which is awesome!
All the feedback helped us prioritize the most requested features, and other
improvements to the backup system.

This release includes a lot of the most requested improvements and
abilities.

### Unencrypted backups

The new backup system came with a lot of security improvements, including
encryption of backups. However, it turns out, many use these backups to
extract and restore single files or configurations. A use case where encryption
made it harder to use.

This release we made two changes to the backup system, to aid with this most
requested feature and use case.

#### Ability to turn off encryption for specific locations

While our default recommendation remains to encrypt backups, as of this
release, you can turn off encryption on a per location basis. This allows you
to store backups on you local NAS, for example, in an unencrypted format.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Temporary screenshot" src="/images/blog/2025-02/encryption-settings.png" />

There is one exception to this, which is Home Assistant Cloud. Backups stored
in Home Assistant Cloud will always be encrypted, and encryption cannot be turned off.
At Nabu Casa, we take your privacy and security very seriously, and we never
ever want to be able to access your data.

#### Downloading backups unencrypted

Downloading backups from the Home Assistant interface will now always download
the backup in an unencrypted format that can be extracted using your favorite
archive tool.

This works for all backups, regardless of the encryption setting of the location
they are stored in. So, if you download an encrypted backup from Home Assistant
Cloud through the Home Assistant interface, it will decrypt the backup on the fly
while you download it.

### Customize the time of your backups

The initial iteration of the backup system scheduled backups to run at 4:45 AM.
And this time, wasn't ideal for everyone. Some, for example, turned off their
NAS systems during the night, meaning the backup would fail.

This release, we added the ability to customize the time of your backups to your
liking. Additionally, if you choose to make weekly backups, you can now select
the days of the week you want the backup to run.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Temporary screenshot" src="/images/blog/2025-02/backup-schedule.png" />

### Taking backups on an advanced schedule

The above backup time changes not flexible enough for you? Well, you are in luck! This
release, we added an action (`backup.automated_backup`) which you can use
to trigger a backup in an automation.

This allows you to create automated backups on any schedule you like, or even
add conditions and actions around it. For example, you could make an automation
that triggers on a calendar, turns on your NAS, waits till it is online, and
then triggers a backup.

### Re-introduction of the backup toggle on update

If you run the Home Assistant OS, you get updates for Home Assistant and
all add-ons. This used to have a toggle to create a backup before updating,
which was removed in the previous release.

This change was made because when running automated regular backups, this
feature was considered redundant. However, we've received a lot of feedback
that this feature was used by many, to ensure they backup the latest data before
updating and, in case of add-ons, to have a backup of the previous version
of the add-on.

Valid cases, and we are re-introducing this backup on update toggle in this
release, but in a smarter way.

#### Backup on updating Home Assistant

When updating Home Assistant, the toggle is now turned off by default and
shows the last time you made a backup. This gives you a clear indication of
when you last made a backup, and gives you the ability to decide if you want
to make a new one before updating.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Temporary screenshot" src="/images/blog/2025-02/backup-toggle-update.png" />

If you turn the switch on, a full automated backup is created and synced to
your configured locations, before the update is started.

This full sync is done to ensure you have the latest backup available in case
the update fails, and you need to restore your system. If a Home Assistant
update would fatally fail, you'd wouldn't have an interface to download or
restore a backup from; hence this path is put in place.

#### Backup on updating add-ons

When updating add-ons, things are slightly different. The toggle exists here
too, and is disabled by default. However, when you enable it, only a backup
of your add-on and its data is created.

That way you can keep around the previous version of the add-on, so you can always roll back to it if needed.

To prevent your system from filling up with old add-on backups, we automatically
delete the previous versions of the add-on backup after a new one is created.

### Improved filenames for backups

One of the feedback we've seen a lot, is that the filenames created by
backups stored on backup locations, have been very cryptic and hard to
understand for humans.

This feedback was fair, as the filename was a hash and originally not designed
to be human readable. This method was not newly introduced last release, but it was made more apparent to us with the new backup system.

So, this release, we've improved the filenames of the backups stored on your
backup locations. The filename now includes the date and time the backup was
created, making it easier to understand and identify the backup you are looking
for, even outside of Home Assistant.

### New locations

This release also introduces new locations to store your backups, there are new integrations for [Google Drive](/integrations/google_drive/) and [Microsoft OneDrive](/integrations/onedrive/), and backup support was added to the [Synology DSM](/integrations/synology_dsm) integration.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Temporary screenshot" src="/images/blog/2025-02/backup-locations.png" />

## Voice

Assist, our [private voice assistant](/voice_control/), is getting a few new features in this release. If you don't have Assist set up yet, check out our [Home Assistant Voice: Preview Edition](/voice-pe/) to get started.

### Home Assistant will be able to call your analog phone to tell you a message

Remember our tutorial to turn an analog phone into [world's most private voice assistant](/voice_control/worlds-most-private-voice-assistant/)? Thanks to [Jamin](https://github.com/jaminh), we now have a way to call your analog phone from Home Assistant!

You can use [`assist_satellite.announce`](/integrations/assist_satellite#action-assist_satelliteannounce) to have Home Assistant call your phone and play a message when someone picks up the phone.

If you use an LLM as the brains for your voice assistant, you can take this one step further with the new [`assist_satellite.start_conversation`](/integrations/assist_satellite#action-assist_satellitestart_conversation) action. Instead of playing an announcement, it starts a conversation between Home Assistant and the user, with Home Assistant saying the first message. Left the garage door open for 30 minutes? No problem, let Home Assistant call the user and ask if they want to close it.

_(Starting a conversation with the default conversation agent is a bit more work and did not make it this release)_

### New Broadcast intent

You can now broadcast messages to every other voice assistant in your home.
Try it by saying "Broadcast it is time for dinner".
As always with new intents, support may vary depending on your language, but our language leaders are working hard on making sure it will be supported soon in your language!

### Setting Temperature on Thermostat

A few releases ago we introduced an intent to get a climate current temperature.
As of this release, you can also set the target temperature of your thermostat by voice.
Try it by saying "Set the temperature to 19 degrees".
This will smartly target the area you are in (if you have a thermostat per area, such as thermostatic valves on your radiators) or the floor you are in (if you only have a central unit). You can also target specific devices by name if you prefer.

### LLMs meet calendars

Without complex custom tooling, LLM-based conversation agents previously could not fetch events from your calendar. This release changes that. Out of the box, LLM-based agents can now retrieve today’s and this week’s events from any of your calendars. Don’t forget to [expose your calendar entities](/voice_control/voice_remote_expose_devices/) to enable this functionality.

### Shared history between the default conversation agent and its LLM-based fallback

In [2024.12](/blog/2024/12/04/release-202412/) we introduced a lovely feature that allowed you to use our fast and local default conversation agent for most queries, and yet be able to fall back to a much more powerful LLM-based agent for more complex queries.

This introduced some interesting behaviors. From a user perspective, it looked like you were talking to the same assistant, whereas, in reality, nothing was shared between the two agents.
This led to some less-than-optimal scenarios, such as this one:

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of missing history in the conversation" src="/images/blog/2025-02/conversation-history-before.png" />

The first command is processed locally by our default agent, but the follow-up request is processed by the LLM-based agent, since no memory is shared, it does not understand what device you want to turn off.

Starting with this release, both agents now share the same command history, fixing completely this issue.

<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the new improved behavior" src="/images/blog/2025-02/conversation-history-after.png" />

### Model Context Protocol

This release adds the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) to Home Assistant thanks to [Allen][@allenporter]. Home Assistant can both be an [MCP server](/integrations/mcp_server/) and an [MCP client](/integrations/mcp/). From the MCP website:

> MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

To give it a try yourself, [check out this client demo](https://gist.github.com/allenporter/b0e9946feb2ab60901c4f467ac1ba6f9).

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "Ecovacs" %}

The attributes on the vacuum entity for the lifespan of the main brush, side
brush, and filter have been deprecated and are now removed. These attributes
are superseded by dedicated sensor entities.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#134492]) ([documentation](/integrations/ecovacs))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#134492]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/134492

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Home Connect" %}

Some appliances might lose their power entity as the API does not report the
power setting.

([@Diegorro98] - [#135930]) ([documentation](/integrations/home_connect))

[@Diegorro98]: https://github.com/Diegorro98
[#135930]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/135930

{% enddetails %}

{% details "IMGW-PIB" %}

Some hydrology data is no longer available to Home Assistant users via IMGW-PIB
API and for this reason, the following entities are removed:

- `flood alarm` binary sensor
- `flood alarm level` sensor
- `flood warning` binary sensor
- `flood warning level` sensor

([@bieniu] - [#134668]) ([documentation](/integrations/imgw_pib))

[@bieniu]: https://github.com/bieniu
[#134668]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/134668

{% enddetails %}

{% details "KNX" %}

The "State Updater" option in the integration settings now works as intended.
Previously, the option wasn’t applied correctly.

- When disabled: KNX will only read a `state_address` once when the connection
  is established.
- When enabled: KNX will also read any `state_address` if no value has been
  received for one hour.

Please review your integration settings to ensure this option is configured
according to your preferences.

([@farmio] - [#135611]) ([documentation](/integrations/knx))

[@farmio]: https://github.com/farmio
[#135611]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/135611

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Litter-Robot" %}

Remove extra_state_attributes from Litter-Robot vacuum entities
These were previously migrated to sensors.

([@natekspencer] - [#136196]) ([documentation](/integrations/litterrobot))

[@natekspencer]: https://github.com/natekspencer
[#136196]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/136196

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT" %}

To change the MQTT broker settings, you need to start a reconfiguration.
When `CONFIGURE` is selected, MQTT shows a "MQTT settings" page with subscribe
and publish tools. The `Re-configure MQTT` button will be replaced with
an `MQTT options` page.

The reconfiguration option will only be available from the MQTT integration
entry context menu.

([@jbouwh] - [#133342]) ([documentation](/integrations/mqtt))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#133342]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/133342

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Pentair ScreenLogic" %}

Raw states derived from ScreenLogic enums are now lowercase instead of Title
Case. This change impacts:

- pH/ORP dosing state sensor entities:
  - `dosing` -> `dosing`
  - `Mixing` -> `mixing`
  - `Monitoring` -> `monitoring`
- The `preset_mode` state attribute for ScreenLogic climatec entities. Where
  raw states have also been underscored-spaced and had any punctuation removed.
  - `Solar` -> `solar`
  - `Solar Preferred` -> `solar_preferred`
  - `Heater` -> `heater`
  - `Don't Change` -> `dont_change`

These changes support the addition of translation keys for text-based entity
states. You should update any references to the above states/preset_modes to
the new, lowercase versions.

([@dieselrabbit] - [#133866]) ([documentation](/integrations/screenlogic))
