### Discover device

After integrating Refoss, it will start socket broadcast and Home Assistant will automatically discover Refoss devices under the current LAN.
  
## Entity naming

The integration uses the following strategy to name its entities:

-  The entity name will be generated by `Device Name` and `Channel Number`.

Single channel device.

Examples:

| Device Name |Channel Number| Entity Name |              
| ----------- | -----------|------------|
| `r10`       | `0`           | r10        |

Multi-channel device.
  
Examples:

| Device Name | Channel Number | Entity Name |              
| ----------- |----------------|----------|
| `r10`       | `0`            | r10      |
| `r10`       | `1`            | r10-1    |

## Reset device

## Troubleshooting

### No devices found on the network

If the Refoss device isn't discovered by Home Assistant automatically, follow these steps:
1. Verify that your Refoss device and Home Assistant are on the same network
2. Enable debug logging for the integration:
   ```yaml
   logger:
     logs:
       homeassistant.components.refoss: debug
   ```
3. Restart Home Assistant and attempt to add the integration again
4. Check the logs for messages containing "Discovered devices"
5. If no devices are found, verify:
   - Network connectivity
   - Device firmware version matches the supported versions listed above
