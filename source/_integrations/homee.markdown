[Homee](https://hom.ee) is a smart home system, able to integrate various protocols such as Z-Wave, Zigbee, EnOcean, and more. The Homee {% term integration %} will let you use the {% term devices %} from your Homee in Home Assistant.

There is currently support for the following device types in Home Assistant:

- cover
- sensor


## Prerequisites

You need to create a new user in your Homee app. Create a user that is only used by Home Assistant. For security reasons, it's recommended to:

- Use a strong, unique password.
- Restrict the user's permissions for what you want to do from Home Assistant.
- Do not use this account for any other purpose.

1. In your Homee app, in the top-left corner, tap the menu button.
2. On the top right of the opening menu, tap the gear {% icon "mdi:gear-outline" %} icon.
3. Choose **Manage users**.
4. Choose **Add user** and configure the desired values.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

{% configuration_basic %}
Host:
  description: The IP Address of your Homee.
User:
  description: The username you chose in the Prerequisites.
Password:
  description: The password for that user.
{% endconfiguration_basic %}

Available devices will automatically show up in your Home Assistant installation.
New devices added to Homee will be automatically discovered after a restart of Home Assistant. This restart is only required when adding new devices, not for state updates of existing devices.

## Limitations

Changed values are reported from Homee in defined time intervals and not always in realtime. For example, while a cover moves, the position is updated only every few seconds and intermediate states may be missed by Home Assistant.

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal, and once the integration is removed, you can also remove the dedicated user from your Homee.
